# Kaleidoscope

Kaleidoscope is an [Espresso][esp] theme using a dark background and vibrant colors, inspired in [Kaleidoscope app website][kscp] by [Sofa][sofa].

To the moment, I just focused into improving HTML and CSS styling. However, I found this a very pleasant experience, and probably find myself adding some more stuff for Javascript, PHP, Markdown and maybe Twig.
